Automation of settings for Windows Operating System

Current Settings that I have scripts for changing automatically:

Power Plan (Setting monitor timeout, standby, turning hibernation off, setting the power button to actually turn off)

Unpinning (Unpins Microsoft Edge, Store and Mail; Removes Taskview, Cortana and News/Interests)

Unpin Registry Edit/Hive (Creates a run once key so that whenever a new user logs onto the computer it unpins the above)

BIOS Update installer (uses chrome to check the manufacturer of the BIOS and downloads the BIOS Update (Lenovo, Dell, HP))
